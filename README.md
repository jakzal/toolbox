# Toolbox

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jakzal/toolbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jakzal/toolbox)
[![Build Status](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/jakzal/toolbox/badges/build.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/jakzal/toolbox/build-status/master)

Helps to discover and install tools.

## Use cases

Toolbox [started its life](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa/blob/49482ae447d4b6341cf77aac9d51390fe1176e8c/tools.php)
as a simple script in the [phpqa docker image](https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa).
Its purpose was to install set of tools while building the docker image and it's still its main goal.
It has been extracted as a separate project to make maintenance easier and enable new use cases.

## Installation

Get the `toolbox.phar` from the [latest release](https://github.com/jakzal/toolbox/releases/latest).
The command below should do the job:

```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/jakzal/toolbox/releases/latest \
  | grep "browser_download_url.*toolbox.phar" \
  | cut -d '"' -f 4 \
  | xargs curl -Ls -o toolbox \
  && chmod +x toolbox
```

## Usage

### List available tools

```
./toolbox list-tools
```

#### Filter tools by tags

To exclude some tools from the listing multiple `--exclude-tag` options can be added.
The `--tag` option can be used to filter tools by tags.

```
./toolbox list-tools --exclude-tag exclude-php:7.3 --exclude-tag foo --tag bar
```

### Install tools

```
./toolbox install
```

#### Install tools in a custom directory

By default tools are installed in the `/usr/local/bin` directory. To perform an installation in another location,
pass the `--target-dir` option to the `install` command. Also, to change the location composer packages are installed in,
export the `COMPOSER_HOME` environment variable.

```
mkdir /tools
export COMPOSER_HOME=/tools/.composer
export PATH="/tools:$COMPOSER_HOME/vendor/bin:$PATH"
./toolbox install --target-dir /tools
```

The target dir can also be configured with the `TOOLBOX_TARGET_DIR` environment variable.

#### Dry run

To only see what commands would be executed, use the dry run mode:

```
./toolbox install --dry-run
```

#### Filter tools by tags

To exclude some tools from the installation multiple `--exclude-tag` options can be added.
The `--tag` option can be used to filter tools by tags.

```
./toolbox install --exclude-tag exclude-php:7.3 --exclude-tag foo --tag bar
```

### Test if installed tools are usable

```
./toolbox test
```

#### Dry run

To only see what commands would be executed, use the dry run mode:

```
./toolbox test --dry-run
```

#### Filter tools by tags

To exclude some tools from the generated test command multiple `--exclude-tag` options can be added.
The `--tag` option can be used to filter tools by tags.

```
./toolbox test --exclude-tag exclude-php:7.3 --exclude-tag foo --tag bar
```

### Tools definitions

By default `resources/pre-installation.json` and `resources/tools.json` are used to load tool definitions.
Definitions can be loaded from customised files by passing the `--tools` option(s):

```
./toolbox list-tools --tools path/to/file1.json --tools path/to/file2.json
```

Tool definition location(s) can be also specified with the `TOOLBOX_JSON` environment variable:

```
TOOLBOX_JSON='path/to/file1.json,path/to/file2.json' ./toolbox list-tools
```

### Tool tags

Tools can be tagged in order to enable grouping and filtering them.

The tags below have a special meaning:

* `pre-installation` - these tools will be installed before any other tools.
* `exclude-php:7.3`, `exclude-php:7.1` etc - used to exclude installation on the specified php version.
